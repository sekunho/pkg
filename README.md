# pkg

A collection of personal crates that I reuse across different projects.

**Use at your own risk**. Please read the license first before using. This does
not cost anything so no support will be given, nor is it likely for me to consider
feature requests beyond my own use cases.

## Packages

- `template`: A templating crate for `jinja2` that uses `minijinja` under the
hood.
